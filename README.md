### General Info
***
**My Movie Watchlist** is an interactive application; were the user can enter the title to a movie and get a list of movies that can then be sorted and saved to a watch list. This project is a collaboration between three students over the course of two weeks in a full stack bootcamp. 
At this point in our course we have just finished server side APIs. We have been given the following perameters to be successful in this project:
- Use a CSS framwork other than Bootstrap
- Be deployed to GitHub Pages
- Be interactive
- Use at least two server side APIs
- Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts
- use client side storage to store persistent data.
- Be responsive.
- have a polished UI.
- Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards.
- have a quality README.
We chose Bulma as our framwork for CSS. It has worked for us but has been a challenge to learn in the two weeks. The two server side APIs are; The Open Movie Database , and The Movie Database API.
